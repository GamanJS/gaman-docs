title: Middleware
description: Middleware in GamanJS provides a powerful way to process requests before they reach the route handler. Middleware can be defined globally for all routes in a Block or scoped to specific paths and HTTP methods. Middleware functions are designed to continue to the next handler when they do not return a response.
---

## Defining Middleware

### Scoped Middleware

Scoped middleware is defined within the `routes` object. It applies to specific paths and can target all methods or specific HTTP methods.

#### Path Middleware

Middleware targeting a specific path is defined using `"/*"` at the end of the path.

```ts
export default defineRoutes(() => ({
  "/user/*": (ctx) => {
    Logger.log("Middleware for all /user/* routes");
  },
}));
```

#### Method-Specific Middleware

Middleware can also be scoped to specific HTTP methods within a path.

```ts
export default defineRoutes(() => ({
  "/user/*": {
    POST: (ctx) => {
      Logger.log("Middleware for POST requests to /user/*");
    },
  },
}));
```

---

### Using the `includes` Property

Middleware can also be included directly using the `includes` property. This allows adding multiple middleware functions in a concise way.

#### Example with Predefined Middleware

```ts
export default defineBlock({
  path: "/api",
  includes: [
    cors({
      origin: "*",
    }),
  ],
  routes: [...]
});
```

#### Example with Custom Middleware

Create a custom middleware:

```ts
// user.middleware.ts
export default defineMiddleware((ctx) => {
  Logger.log("Custom middleware executed");
  return next();
});
```

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

<Aside type="tip">
  you can use the CLI's Block maker:

  <PackageManagers pkgManagers={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]} type="exec" args="gaman make:middleware <name>"/>
</Aside>

Use the custom middleware:

```ts
export default defineBlock({
  path: "/user",
  includes: [userMiddleware()],
  routes: [...]
});
```

---

## Example

### Routes

```ts
export default defineRoutes(() => ({
  "/user/*": {
    POST: (ctx) => {
      Logger.log("POST middleware for /user/*");
    },
    GET: (ctx) => {
      Logger.log("GET middleware for /user/*");
    },
  },
  "/user": {
    GET: (ctx) => {
      return Response.json({ message: "User Data" });
    },
  },
}));
```

### Block with Middleware

```ts
export default defineBlock({
  path: "/api",
  includes: [
    cors({
      origin: "*",
    }),
    userMiddleware(),
  ],
  routes: [userRoutes],
});
```

### Request Flow

1. A request to `POST /api/user/123` will:

   - Trigger the middleware in `includes` (e.g., `cors` and `userMiddleware`).
   - Trigger the `POST` middleware for `/user/*`.
   - Proceed to the route handler if no response is returned by the middleware.

2. A request to `GET /api/user` will:
   - Trigger the middleware in `includes` (e.g., `cors` and `userMiddleware`).
   - Skip the `/user/*` middleware since the path does not match.
   - Execute the `GET` handler for `/user`.

---

## Best Practices

- **Keep Middleware Lightweight**: Avoid complex logic that might delay the request processing.
- **Organize Middleware**: Use meaningful path names and group related middleware into Blocks.
- **Terminate or Continue Clearly**: Explicitly `return next();` to make continuation clear and intentional.

---

## Additional Notes

- Middleware runs sequentially, and order matters.
- The `includes` property provides flexibility for global middleware.
- Path-based middleware now supports patterns like `"/*"`, `"*"`, `"*/user"`, or `"/user/*"`.
- Ensure that middleware does not inadvertently block further processing unless intended.
