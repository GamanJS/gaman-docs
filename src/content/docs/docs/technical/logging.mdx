title: Logging

---

**Gaman Logger** is a built-in utility of GamanJS that makes the logging process easier in your project. With this logger, you don't need to import additional modules because this function is already available **globally**.

Why use **Gaman Logger**?

The answer is simple: to make your console cooler ðŸ˜Ž (and a bit tidier too). No special reason other than that, hehe.

## Logger API

GamanJS provides a global function named **`Log`** with various log levels. Here is the list of available levels:

- `Log.log(message: any)`

- `Log.info(message: any)`

- `Log.debug(message: any)`

- `Log.warn(message: any)`

- `Log.error(message: any)`

### Note:

- `Log.info` has the same function as `Log.log`, only different label to be more semantic.

## Usage Example

 ```ts
 Log.log("This is a normal log");
 Log.info("This is information");
 Log.debug("Debugging info");
 Log.warn("This is a warning");
 Log.error("An error occurred");
 ```
