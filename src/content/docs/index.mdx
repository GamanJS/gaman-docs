## What is GamanJS?

GamanJS is a JavaScript framework focused on backend application development. This framework was born from a hobby of building things that actually got finished (unlike previous projects that never made it to completion 😅).

## 🧠 Name Philosophy

The name "Gaman" is taken from Japanese words like "gaman shinasai" or "gaman dekinai" which mean to be patient or endure. This philosophy reflects the spirit of staying patient and consistent in developing something until it's complete.

## ✨ Motivation

It started as just a hobby project. Usually, other projects never get finished, but somehow GamanJS made it to the end. That's why there's now motivation to keep developing this framework further.

Developed by an individual under the name 7TogkID, GamanJS continues to evolve by adding various functions and utilities useful for backend development.

## Development Focus

- **Backend-First**: Designed specifically for backend application needs
- **Utility Rich**: Continuously adding functions and utilities that make development easier
- **Fullstack Capable**: Can also be used for fullstack, but primarily backend-focused

GamanJS is here to help developers build backend applications with a simple yet powerful approach.
