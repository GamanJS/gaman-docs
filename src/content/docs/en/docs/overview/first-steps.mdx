description: GamanJS is a modular and efficient backend framework designed for simplicity and performance. Follow the steps below to quickly get started with your first GamanJS project.

### Language

GamanJS is specifically designed to work with ***TypeScript*** and modern ***JavaScript*** using the ***ECMAScript (ESM)*** module system. This means all modules must be written using **import** and **export** syntax; CommonJS (require, module.exports) is not supported. If you are building a project with GamanJS, ensure your environment and codebase are fully compatible with **ESM**.

### Prerequisites

Please ensure `Node.js` (version >= 20.x) is installed on your operating system.
