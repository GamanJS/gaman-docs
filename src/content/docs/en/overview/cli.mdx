The Gaman Command Line Interface has several commands as follows:

## Common

### `gaman dev`
`gaman dev` is an alias for `npm run dev` and is useful for running the Gaman app in development mode.

Example:
```bash
# node
npx gaman dev

# or
npm run dev
```

### `gaman build`
`gaman build` is an alias for `npm run build` and is useful for building your project to production mode. After building, the result will be in the `dist/**` folder by default.

Example:
```bash
# node
npx gaman build

# or
npm run build
```

### `gaman start`
`gaman start` is an alias for `npm start` and is useful for running the app in production mode that you've already built. So, before `gaman start`, you must build first.

Example:
```bash
# node
npx gaman start

# or
npm start
```

Here I give a bonus if you want to deploy with `pm2`, you can use the following command:
```bash
pm2 start --name your-project-name "npm start"
```
Or you can go directly to the GamanJS entry point, which is `dist/index.js`.
Example:
```bash
pm2 start --name your-project-name "dist/index.js"
```
