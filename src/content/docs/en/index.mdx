## What is Gaman?

GamanJS is a JavaScript framework focused on backend applications. Initially, this project was created just as a hobby. And congratulations to me, this is the largest project I've ever made.

## Philosophy

The name ***Gaman*** is taken from Japanese words like "gaman shinasai" or "gaman dekinai" which mean to be patient or endure. This philosophy reflects the spirit to remain patient and consistent in developing something to completion.

## Motivation

Starting from just a hobby project. Usually, other projects never finish, but somehow GamanJS managed to achieve it. That's why now there's motivation to continue developing this framework.

Developed by an individual under the name 7TogkID, GamanJS continues to evolve by adding various functions and utilities useful for backend development.

## Why Indonesian?

Because actually I'm not very good at English, I once made English documentation from translate + AI, the language became weird and hard to understand (according to people who use Gaman).

So I decided to target the local market first, which is (Indonesia).

And I hope someone helps contribute to creating English documentation :)
